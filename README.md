# Doom Fire Algorithm
An implementation of the oldest code that have made the Doom's fire works

Here we can see the behavior of the numbers:

I would very much like to thank Felipe Deschamps, from the channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU5JicSrEM5A63jkJ2QvGYw", for making the video about this algorithm, video which encouraged me to implement the code and reactivate skills with Java .
Not least, I would also like to thank Elisandro, from the channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_nimJbHn0xRqFa7YWIS0oA", who helped me clear up my doubts about the implementation, through message exchange and screen sharing with the same.
